# Hand-Accelerometer-Controlled-Car
With an accelerometer, uses specific hand gestures to move the car forward, backward, left, and right. Create a GUI alongside that displays information of the car.

Materials Used: Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano, 433 MHZ transmitter and receiver, accelerometer, sparkfun motor driver, motors, servo, LEDs

Upload "haccUno" to the arduino uno, and "haccNano" to the nano. Run the writeCsv file, then run the gui file to display the gui. The arduino uno must be plugged into the computer and the serial port must be adjusted accordingly in the writeCsv file for the GUI to be displayed.

Pinout is written in each arduino file
